- Use Vitest for testing
- Suggest all tests before generating code; implement tests one at a time
- create tests in the same director as the component in their own file.
- Use React Testing Library for testing React components
- Use Jest DOM for testing DOM elements
- Use the `describe` block for each major set of tests
- Share mock components between tests within a file without duplicating code
- Use the `it` block for each individual test case
- Use the `beforeEach` block to set up any necessary state or props before each test
- Use the `afterEach` block to clean up any state or props after each test
- Use the `expect` function to make assertions about the rendered output
- Explicitly import the testing utilities from React Testing Library, vitest and Jest DOM
