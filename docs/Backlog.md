## How stories and work items are recorded in the backlog

What the process for this is.

[]: # - How are stories and work items prioritized?

Stories and work items are prioritized by importance as discussed by the team and client. Most important and time-sensitive items are at the top of the list.

[]: # - How are stories and work items estimated?

We will discuss the estimation for stories and work items during team meetings. Everyone will discuss how long they think each item will take and come to a consensus.

[]: # - How are stories and work items assigned to team members?
We will assign work items to team members at team meetings and also through group chat communication. We will decide which tasks should be assigned first, and members can choose the tasks they want to take on. To avoid siloing, team members will try to take on different components of the app each week and work in pairs or small groups.

[]: # - How are stories and work items tracked?

Stories and work items are tracked on the GitHub Projects board. Team members will move tasks from left to right as they reach different stages (backlog, ready, in progress, in review, done). We will also communicate updates in the group chat.

[]: # - How are stories and work items reported on?

Stories and work items will be reported on during team meetings as bigger updates, while smaller updates and anything between meetings will be communicated over group chat. We will compile our updates for our weekly meetings with the client.

[]: # - How are stories and work items archived?

Stores and work items are archived in the done section of the GitHub Projects board when they have been fully reviewed by the team and client and agreed upon to be completed.
