# Product Owner for Client Meetings

How is the product owner designated for the first client meetings? is it permanent or rotated? Who is it for each team in the tribe

We'll do rotating product owners each week. For this first week, Team Blue will be Zain and Team Red will be Emma S. Lauren and Zain will be the primary contact with Jeremiah for the whole quarter. Primary contact will send out meeting minutes, action items, and meeting links to client.

# Team Coordination within the tribe

How are issues between teams within the tribe raised?
What is the forum for discussion of issues between the teams?
When does that happen? Who is required to be present?

We present issues in our groupchat. If we notice any issues, we should immediately message the group to notify everyone. Whoever is raising the issues is required to be present.

# Team Communication

What is the principal way to communicate between tribes? email? discord? slack? message group? What is the address or way to join this method of communication?

We have iMessage groupchat and Slack as our primary forms of communication. We'll use Discord as well to facilitate online pair programming. Contact the primary contacts to be added.

# Client Meeting Time

When is the client meeting each week? Is it static or does it move? who is responsible for coordinating with the client?

Meeting on Fridays at 11AM. Static for now.
